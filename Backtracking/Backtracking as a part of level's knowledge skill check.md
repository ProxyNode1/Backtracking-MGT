# Backtracking as a part of level's knowledge skill check
2024-01-10

As the knowledge of the level is equally important as physical skills, the level designers can use this as a skill check in the levels and make the player backtrack if they fail the check.

In games such as Hitman, and Resident Evil: Code Veronica, the knowledge of level is a crucial for survival and successfully completing the level. If the player lacks the knowledge, they have to backtrack out of the area to a familiar area. Mattias Engström, the game director of Hitman 2 (2018) in their interview with NoClip says, at first this experience will be frustrating as the players are still building the knowledge of the level in the mind, and once they get master that they will feel happy again.
