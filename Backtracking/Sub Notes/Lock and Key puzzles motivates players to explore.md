Lock and key style puzzle design in games like resident evil 1, 2, 3, CV acts as a motivator for exploration of interconnected game spaces.

### Reference:

“Resident Evil dilutes most of the challenge out of the key-lock process and uses it simply as a function of having the player crisscross (i.e., explore) the game world. The same template serves Super Metroid, Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, and the legion of Metroidvania Kickstarter projects in their wake. These games, like Resident Evil, are about exploring an interconnected space through a series of locks and keys that prompt movement through the game world.” (Totten, 2017, p. 22) (pdf)
