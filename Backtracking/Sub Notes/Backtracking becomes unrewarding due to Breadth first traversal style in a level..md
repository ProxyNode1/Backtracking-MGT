# Backtracking becomes unrewarding due to Breadth first traversal style in a level.

The level can be considered as a graph of nodes, where nodes are different micro areas within the level, for example, buildings or rooms, and the vertexes of the graph are the routes between each micro area.

The level in deathloop, The Longest Day, the player can choose to traverse this level (as a graph) in either depth first or breadth first fashion until they reach the goal which is on the other side of level.

After finishing the level, the player has to walk all the way back to the beginning of the level. If the player has moved through the level in a breadth first approach or in a certain way, on the return journey they do not experience anything new since, due to their way to moving through the level, they have already seen everything in the level.
