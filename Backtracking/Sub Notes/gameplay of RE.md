[[Mental Model and Resident Evil's Puzzle Box Design]]

#### Reference:
“What engages the players of Resident Evil is the puzzle box environment and the mental models, planning, and execution required to solve it.” (Totten, 2017, p. 20)

“Resident Evil’s moment to moment gameplay tends to be dictated by item locks and keys more so than boss battles, which are few in number.” (Totten, 2017, p. 22)

“These games, like Resident Evil, are about exploring an interconnected space through a series of locks and keys that prompt movement through the game world.” (Totten, 2017, p. 22)

“By having the player pass through the save rooms and move between floors and between the front and back sides of the Palace and Training Facility, the game is not just familiarizing the player with the building blocks of the new environments, but they are modeling the paths and pit stops that they will be using when putting keys to lock in the “Testing the Model” chapter.” (Totten, 2017, p. 34)
