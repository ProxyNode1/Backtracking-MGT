# Constantly moving from one end of a level to the other leads to boredom 

Repetition often leads to boredom, and in the case of video games, players feel bored when they are made to play essentially the same gameplay (Byrne, 2005). Though, backtracking through a level can be interesting if the level has changed sufficiently or if there is a new challenge on the way back, (Taylor, 2013) calls this bi-directional gameplay. However, forcing the player to constantly go around the map, spending long time trudging through the same space, reduces the flow to a crawl, which in turn leads to boredom.
