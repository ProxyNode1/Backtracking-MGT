# Backtracking in Castlevania SOTN

In the video game Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, the player reaches the "Clock Room" quite early in the video game. Initially, the player can only enter the room from Left or Right, while other entrances are inaccessible. Once the player unlocks the ability to double jump, an ability to jump while in the air, and then make their way to the "Clock Room" they see that one additional path can now be accessed. In similar fashion, as the player gains more abilities rest of the entrances open up.

	- In the game Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, the player has to explore a giant castle but will be impeded at various points due to the player not having the required skills or items to proceed. These items and skills are acquired through the course of the game, thus requiring the player to go back to earlier areas of the castle that were previously inaccessible, i.e. backtrack, in order to advance the game. Once of those areas the player often needs to backtrack to is known as the “Clock Room” and is encountered fairly early on in the game. Initially, the player can only enter from the left or right, with the other potential entrances (entrance 1 through 4, see Fig. 15) being inaccessible. Once the player gains the ability to double-jump (a jump common in games where the player gains access to an additional jump while airborne), the player can enter entrance 1 and 3. Once the player gains the ability to fly, the player can enter entrance 2 as well. Finally, once the player procures two specific items within the game and wears them, the fourth entrance will open as well.
