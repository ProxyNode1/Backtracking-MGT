2024-01-09

In Resident Evil 1, 2, 3, or Code Veronica, the knowledge of the level is equally important as the skills to fight against the enemies. This factor determines if the player can make it to their destination or not. 

Since, the lock and key progression style of the game asks the player to explore an interconnected space, If the player has good enough information of the level, ie their mental model of the level, they know which places might have zombies, or which route will be the safest towards their destination. if the player that does not have this knowledge, they might run into a large group of zombies, while they search for resources or route to their next objective. 

The players are required to constantly make decisions about where they have to go and what the safest routes to get there, this knowledge becomes extra crucial in their journey.

“What engages the players of Resident Evil is the puzzle box environment and the mental models, planning, and execution required to solve it.” (Totten, 2017, p. 20)

“In real-time action games such as Resident Evil, knowledge of the game world and the dexterity, reflex, and timing needed to defend oneself against enemies are both essential sets of skills, and different players will strike a different balance between the two.” (Totten, 2017, p. 21)

“In Resident Evil, two forms of locks engineer player progression: item locks and boss battles.” (Totten, 2017, p. 21)

“They account for space in their inventory when entering a new area and plan their save room pit stops to avoid backtracking for supplies.” (Totten, 2017, p. 22) Backtracking can be used to allow players to make strategic plans.

“These games, like Resident Evil, are about exploring an interconnected space through a series of locks and keys that prompt movement through the game world.” (Totten, 2017, p. 22) *It is about exploration from the mental challenge's perspective.*

Resident Evil dilutes most of the challenge out of the key-lock process and uses it simply as a function of having the player crisscross (i.e., explore) the game world.” (Totten, 2017, p. 22)

“know which rooms hold locks, which rooms hold resources, which rooms hold enemies, and which routes are possible and therefore the safest and shortest to their destination are at an advantage. Resident Evil is a game of mental frameworks, where success hinges on the player’s ability to build a working model of the game world in their head.” (Totten, 2017, p. 23)

“What the discussion so far has demonstrated, though, is that the survival elements of Resident Evil increase the significance of decision making and thereby increase the potency of knowledge as a dynamic force that underpins player actions.” (Totten, 2017, p. 25)
