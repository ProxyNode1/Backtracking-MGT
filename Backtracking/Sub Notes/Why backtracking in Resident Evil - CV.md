“The relationship between the key (player actions used to defeat the enemies) and the lock (barriers) allows the designers to establish the core gameplay, in this case combat.” (Totten, 2017, p. 21)

“These games, like Resident Evil, are about exploring an interconnected space through a series of locks and keys that prompt movement through the game world.” (Totten, 2017, p. 22) *It is about exploration from the mental challenge's perspective.*

Resident Evil dilutes most of the challenge out of the key-lock process and uses it simply as a function of having the player crisscross (i.e., explore) the game world.” (Totten, 2017, p. 22)

“One of the tensions that the Resident Evil games thrive on is that few players are able to retain enough information or recall the right information to make informed choices all the time. At some point they will be caught short and forced to walk blindly into the unknown.” (Totten, 2017, p. 24)

"These two points, the Barracks and the backtracker, may seem inconsequential, but they demonstrate the subtle ways in which the player’s decisions determine the flow of information and thereby shape their mental model.” (Totten, 2017, p. 30)

“The extra resources come at the expense of being distracted from the main thread of progression and having to retain important information for a longer period of time. Along the same lines, if key clues are overlooked or forgotten, players have the freedom to backtrack and fill any holes. This backtracking is not necessarily a waste of time as all observation feeds into the underlying knowledge game and strengthens the model. Today’s backtracker may be rewarded the knowledge to make them tomorrow’s assertive player. (Totten, 2017, p. 30)

“The locks and keys see the player traverse the length of the Prison four times before they leave. The backtracking teaches players that enemies and resources have permanence and do not disappear or respawn once the player leaves the room.” (Totten, 2017, p. 31)

“Frequently visited rooms harden into long-term memory, less visited rooms are pushed into the background, and resource rooms mined of their worth are removed.” (Totten, 2017, p. 34)

“This is where the decay of retention and the associated tension creep into the gameplay.” (Totten, 2017, p. 35)

“By having the player pass through the save rooms and move between floors and between the front and back sides of the Palace and Training Facility, the game is not just familiarizing the player with the building blocks of the new environments, but they are modeling the paths and pit stops that they will be using when putting keys to lock in the “Testing the Model” chapter.” (Totten, 2017, p. 34)

“forcing the player to rewire their neural networks to accommodate the designers’ reinterpretation of the building.” (Totten, 2017, p. 38)
