# Player backtracks due to poor level guidance leading to bad PX
2024-01-12

Francis D.K. Ching, in the book Architecture: Form, Space, Order, says intersection, as it connects multiple paths, is a point where a person has to make a decision about where they want to go and which path to to take to reach their destination, and if they have no way of knowing which path could help them progress the level, they are stuck wandering around.

For example, during the development of half life 2 episode 2's level This Vortal Coil, the designer Greg Coomer, talks about how they had a tunnel in the level with a fork to go right or left. By taking the left path, the player progresses in the level and taking the right path, the player eventually comes to the same fork again.  During playtesting they saw that a player would repeatedly take right path for 30 mins without realizing that they were basically following the same path. Which is why the designers decided to disallow the player to go right completely, to tell them clearly which path do they have to take by removing a maze-like element.

Danial Johnson observes something similar in Chapter 8 of Resident Evil Code Veronica. The player has to use an elevator, but only in this instance, this elevator goes down directly to 4 floors instead of one. There is also an area in the same chapter call Ant Farm, which is under the ground but has floors and ceilings that extents beyond the limit of the building and the walls are painted blue. Daniel points out that the illusory nature of the Ant farm and the inconsistent behaviour of the elevator makes it difficult to build a mental model and determine how to progress.
