# Mastery over the knowledge of the level - Hitman
2024-01-10

Knowledge of a level can be used as a way to challenge the player. In the beginning, it will be frustrating to the player as they are still learning their ways around the level, often times running into other problems such as enemies. But the more they play the level the more they will get to know the level and until they master it.

Players who mastered the level, they will feel cleaver because they figured it out.

“I had this design philosophy that the first time you go in there and you try to find that it will not be comfortable and it will not be easy to find your way around. But, the more you play it, the more you get to know it. If you play it a lot, and you master it, you will feel satisfied. That ties into knowing who the Maelstrom is. And, you can see the players who play it a lot, they're like, "Ah, I really like this," because they feel clever figuring it out. And the players who don't play it a lot, they feel lost in the level, they didn't get to master it, it's claustrophobic, they don't know, "I'm getting busted by these guards." There's a quote from one of the forums, I can't remember, but, "I started hating Mumbai, but now it's my favorite map." - I think the hard part, when we have these big events, is there's a lot of movement, there's a lot of expectations, and there's a lot of ways you can destroy them.” - Mattias Engström
