# Bounce in Half Life 2

During the level Highway 17 of Half Life 2, the player fights off enemies until they reach a force field that blocks the bridge and their progression. The player reaches the end of the bridge by following a walkway under it and pushes a button that makes force field passable. On their way back, they encounter a combine helicopter which the player fights before progressing through the force field.

To disable it, the buggy must be left behind and the player has to climb their way beneath the bridge to the other side and push a button in a control room. Then, on the way back, a Combine gunship must be fought off, after which the player can proceed through the force field.” (“Bounce (level design) - Valve Developer Community”, p. 2)
