# Inconsistent Elevator - Resident Evil Code Veronica
2024-01-14

During the chapter 8, Antarctica Transport Terminal of Resident Evil Code Veronica, player encounters an elevator that takes them from scanners to Mansion Courtyard, but only in this instance the elevator travels more than one floor at a time, in this case it travels 4 floor at a time. 

Daniel Johnson points out that as the game is about building a mental model of the level and navigating the level based on that, this inconsistent behavior of the elevator adds confusion to that model.

“The other dimension to this issue is the skewed representation of floors. The elevator that connects the corridor with the scanners and the Mansion Courtyard (i.e., the left-hand entrance of the upside-down T) drops the player four stories, from B1 to B5. This is the only time in the game where an elevator moves more than one floor without informing the player. Sure, the time spent taking the elevator is longer than usual, but I don’t think that this in and of itself is a sufficient tell, especially when you consider the random handful of doors that have longer-than-usual opening animations. If the player works within the assumptions presented, a number of contradictions reveal themselves. But even if we disregard the poor communication of the elevator, it’s not hard to be confounded by the logic of the underground environments.” (Totten, 2017, p. 48)
