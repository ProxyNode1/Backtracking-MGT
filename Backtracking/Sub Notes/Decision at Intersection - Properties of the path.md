# Decision at Intersection - Properties of the path
2024-01-14

Intersection, as it connects multiple paths, is a point where a person has to make a decision about where they want to go, and which path to take to reach their destination. 

Properties of the path can be used to identify if the path will lead us to a major area or a secondary area.

“The intersection or crossing of paths is always a point of decision-making for the person approaching it. The continuity and scale of each path at an intersection can help us distinguish between major routes leading to major spaces and secondary paths leading to lesser spaces.” (Ching, 2007, p. 279)
