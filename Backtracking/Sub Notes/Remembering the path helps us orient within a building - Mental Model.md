The design of a path, within a building, influences and is influenced by the spaces it links. Francis D. K. Ching, suggests that remembering the paths within a building helps us to orient ourselves within the building and understand the spatial layout of it.

“The nature of the configuration of a path both influences and is influenced by the organizational pattern of the spaces it links. The configuration of a path may reinforce a spatial organization by paralleling its pattern, or the configuration may contrast with the form of the spatial organization and serve as a visual counter point to it. 
Once we are able to map out in our minds the overall configuration of the paths in a building, our orientation within the building and our understanding of its spatial layout will be made clear.” (Ching, 2007, p. 279)
