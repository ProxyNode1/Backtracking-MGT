# Teaching by repetition
2024-01-12

As the levels of Resident Evil: Code Veronica repeatedly tests the player's mental model, the errors in the model are rectified and which are replaced by new information and insight about the level, strengthening the model.

Resident Evil: Code Veronica also has the same structure for the level in their prison chapter, which acts as the tutorial mission, to prepare the players for the actual first chapter of the game set in Rockfort.

Apart from this, as the player traverses the level multiple times within a short period, they are also shown that if they havent picked up an item, it will still be there, but it will not respawn if the player has already picked it up.

“The locks and keys see the player traverse the length of the Prison four times before they leave. The backtracking teaches players that enemies and resources have permanence and do not disappear or respawn once the player leaves the room.” (Totten, 2017, p. 31)

“The Prison tutorial can be thought of as a miniaturization of Claire’s main adventures on Rockfort. The initial information-gathering period (the linear walk) and the subsequent pursuit of active leads (the complex lock)—the tutorial’s two halves—correspond to this chapter, “Building the Foundation,” and the subsequent chapter, “Testing the Model.”” (Totten, 2017, p. 31)
