do they do something to make this take less effort? for example, let the player walk around the level so they are familiar with the layout before presenting them with a gate so that they know what could be the solutions and where do they exist in the level?

Or do they present them in the typical puzzle design way of showing the gate or the problem first and them letting the player find and figure out the solution?
