# Disallowing backtracking to build anticipation in PT

Moments of anticipation in video games involves potential choices, a way to evaluate those choices, and the outcomes of those choices (Upton, 2016). If the player encounters those moments again, instead of looking and weighing the potential choices, they move forward with familiar decisions. But, establishing familiar patterns then breaking those pattern not only adds variety to the experience, but those instances of unfamiliarity, calls the player's attention to their current situation and sets off the anticipatory play. 

However reducing the choices also leads to anticipatory play. Brian observed this in the design of the one-way doors at the beginning and end of the corridors in P.T. Taking away the choice to backtrack through those doors takes away the player's ability to make any decisions other then to move forward and directs their attention to their current situation and what they are going to encounter next. This way, the level designer tries to create and then break the patterns to offer more scarier experience to the player.

	- “If we repeatedly encounter the same situation, we remember how our anticipatory play previously played out and instead of experiencing the fun of sifting through potentialities, we converge instantly on a familiar resolution.” (Totten, 2017, p. 189)

	- “The idea is not to eliminate repetition entirely. The idea is to use targeted instants of interrupted repetition to call the player’s attention to the uncertainty of their current situation and set off a cascade of anticipatory play.” (Totten, 2017, p. 190)
	- “The one-way door in P.T. is important because it’s a powerful example of how reducing interaction can increase the playfulness of a game. If there were more things for the player to interact with in the first half of the corridor, if backtracking offered the hope of finding a safer route, if there were more meaningful gameplay choices to make, then thinking our options would crowd out the interpretive choices that make P.T. scary. The use of a one-way door to eliminate the possibility of backtracking directs our attention away from planning our escape and toward interpreting our ominous situation.” (Totten, 2017, p. 198)
