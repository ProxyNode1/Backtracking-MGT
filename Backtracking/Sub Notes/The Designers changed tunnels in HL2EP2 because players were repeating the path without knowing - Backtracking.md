# The Designers changed tunnels in HL2EP2 because players were repeating the path without knowing - Backtracking
2024-01-12

The designer Greg Coomer, say that during the development of Half Life 2 Episode 2's level This Vortal Coil, the player would come up to a fork in a tunnel in Antlion Guardian's lair where they can go either right or left. If the player takes the right, they would eventually return to the place they started.

But, during the playtesting of that level, they saw a player continue to go right all the time for 30 mins, without realizing it. Which is why they decided to block the right path in that fork.

Before we simplified the path through the guardian's lair, we allowed a right turn at this junction, leading the player right back to where they began. One of our playtesters continued to repeatedly turn right here for half an hour. That was a compelling argument for removing the mazelike elements.
