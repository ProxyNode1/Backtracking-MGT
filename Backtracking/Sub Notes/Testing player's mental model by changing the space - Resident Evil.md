# Testing player's mental model by changing the space - Resident Evil
2024-01-10

on 2nd visit to Rockfort in Resident Evil Code Veronica, the Airport is repopulated with enemies. Training Facility has changed both visually and has new areas to visit while a few areas, that the player previously traversed, are now blocked.

By making the player move through a familiar area that has changed, the designers are asking the players to reinterpret the information of the level they have stored in their mind during their last visit.

“Despite initial appearances, this is not a true return to Rockfort Island. Chris is limited to the Training Facility and Airport, the latter of which remains identical to how the player last left it, albeit with a fresh smattering of undead workmen.” (Totten, 2017, p. 38)

“The return to the Training Facility and the variety of changes that come with it force the player to once again reevaluate their mental model. This time, though, their conception of the facility is further entrenched in their long-term memory and the process of reconciling the differences is much more complicated.” (Totten, 2017, p. 41)

“Where “Testing the Model” is transformational in being additive to the player’s mental model, “Revising the Structure” is transformational in reinterpreting the model.” (Totten, 2017, p. 42)

“Players’ reinterpretation of the Training Facility is supported by the unused locks and keys from their previous escapades on Rockfort as Claire.” (Totten, 2017, p. 42)
