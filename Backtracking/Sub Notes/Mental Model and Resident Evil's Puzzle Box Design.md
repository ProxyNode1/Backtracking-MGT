# Mental Model and Resident Evil's Puzzle Box Design
2024-01-10

The levels of resident evil act as a puzzle box and it engages the players by asking them to create a mental model of the level which in-turn helps the players to plan and execute a solution.

“What engages the players of Resident Evil is the puzzle box environment and the mental models, planning, and execution required to solve it.” (Totten, 2017, p. 20)

“we are focusing almost exclusively on the mental challenges that take place in the player’s mind.” (Totten, 2017, p. 21)

“Resident Evil’s moment to moment gameplay tends to be dictated by item locks and keys more so than boss battles, which are few in number.” (Totten, 2017, p. 22)

“In order to complete a Resident Evil game, one needs to play so as to minimize risk.” (Totten, 2017, p. 22)

“When faced with limited resources, a high threat of failure, and the interconnection of locks and keys spread across the environment, there exists a strong impetus to put whatever relevant information one can obtain from the game world to use.” (Totten, 2017, p. 23)

“Given the weight of each decision, the frequency at which players encounter them, and the way choices ripple forward in time to affect subsequent choices, players are able to mold their own unique survival horror experience out of Resident Evil’s gameplay.” (Totten, 2017, p. 26)

“The narrative details shared through the environment provide the player with context that helps them organize their schema and elaborate information into their long-term memory.” (Totten, 2017, p. 27)

“That is, we intuitively use the narrative clues provided to us to craft our own stories (mnemonics) that aid in the memorization process.” (Totten, 2017, p. 27)

“The environmental storytelling is not merely window dressing, though. As we know, mental models are built on linkages between individual pieces of knowledge: the more connected the information, the stronger the memory network.” (Totten, 2017, p. 27)

“By the end of a Resident Evil game, the player is likely to feel a strong connection with the game world because they have come to internalize it as part of their play experience” (Totten, 2017, p. 27)

“As they progress, the player slowly develops the foundation of their model, which will not be put to use until after the intermission that divides “Building the Foundation” and “Testing the Model.”” (Totten, 2017, p. 31)

“Frequently visited rooms harden into long-term memory, less visited rooms are pushed into the background, and resource rooms mined of their worth are removed.” (Totten, 2017, p. 34)

“By having the player pass through the save rooms and move between floors and between the front and back sides of the Palace and Training Facility, the game is not just familiarizing the player with the building blocks of the new environments, but they are modeling the paths and pit stops that they will be using when putting keys to lock in the “Testing the Model” chapter.” (Totten, 2017, p. 34)

“Their mental model, a culmination of their individual decisions, observations, and encoded information, is the compass that guides progression.” (Totten, 2017, p. 35)

“Organizing the model and encoding details into one’s long-term memory is therefore an easier process than if the environments were a contextual jumble and the main thread of progression were less straightforward.” (Totten, 2017, p. 33)
