# Frustrations in interconnected space

#### Example:
- [[Interconnected spaces enable the players to find the optimal way to complete an objective]]
- [[Distinctness in ways to approach an objective in an Interconnected Space - Random choice]]
- [[The Designers changed tunnels in HL2EP2 because players were repeating the path without knowing - Backtracking]]
- [[Backtracking becomes unrewarding due to Breadth first traversal style in a level.]]
