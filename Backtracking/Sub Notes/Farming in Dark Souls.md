# Farming in Dark Souls

On using a bonfire in the game dark souls, enemy NPCs in the game respawns. This gives the player opportunity to combat the these enemies, again. If the player engages with the enemy and wins the combat, they are generally rewarded by either a weapon, an armor piece, souls, etc. Souls is the currency that is used to upgrade their character, and the more enemies the player engages in the combat with, the probability of getting souls increases.

The game also has rings the player can equip such as [Covetous Silver Serpent Ring](https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Covetous+Silver+Serpent+Ring) or the [Symbol of Avarice](https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Symbol+of+Avarice). These items increases the number of souls earned by 20% each and on equipping both of these items, the soul gain percent increases to 44%.
