# Discouraging backtracking for reward exclusivity in Cyberpunk 2077

The level designer working on Cyberpunk 2077, in order to give each player a special experience despite their choice of the path and create a non-linear level, divided the level in 2 beats. 

The first beat is called discovery. In this beat, the designer asks the player to look for paths to progress and then pick a path from the available choices.

The second beat is called exploration. This is where the designer narrows down the level to deliver unique experience to the player based on the path they chose in the last beat. To deliver that experience, they tried to isolate the path from the other paths to heighten the sense of exclusivity.

The level designers of cyberpunk 2077 create paths in exploration beat in a way that the player will want to progress on the path they have chosen. They make it more appealing and in order to do that they isolate the paths from each other and add cost to switching the paths, for example the player will have to sneak past a particularly deadly enemy to get to a different path.

 - [[Benefits of Missing Out - What 'Cyberpunk 2077' Taught Us About Non-Linear Level Design]]
	 - how to create nonlinear levels that give each player, no matter which path they pick, a more special experience.
	   
	 - However, looking at it from the perspective of creating memorable nonlinear experiences in game play, it's hard to give real value to play styles with this approach.”
	   
	 - “This beat, Discovery, is primarily about the player discovering their options, making their choices, and overcoming challenges.”
	   
	 - “Once the player made their choice and successfully passed through the discovery area, they now find themselves in our exploration beat, and the exploration beat provides a more intimate and linear experience compared to discovery. 31:04 It does this by narrowing down the level and what the player can see of the rest of the location, restricting them to the path they have chosen. 31:13 The intent is to let the player focus on exploring and experiencing the choice they committed to, and this beat is less about making new choices and much more about the consequence of choosing. 
	   
	 - “Exploration is where that awesome lives. 32:02 It's the player experiencing the consequences of their choice of picking a path, and for doing so, exploration rewards the player. 32:12 It's not only great from the player's perspective, but also from ours as storytellers. 32:18 This structure allows us to still expose the player to important narrative elements and cinematic moments, while giving the individual player a more unique experience.”
	   
	 - Perception of Exclusivity, prevents them from knowing the alternative outcome and heightens a sense of wonder. 37:57 The more exclusive and isolated a path feels, the more special it can become in the player's mind. 38:02 Without a perception of exclusivity, we destroy all chances of players to even wonder whether another path might result in a different outcome.”
	   
	 - “Furthermore, to fully allow the player to focus on the path, commit them to a choice by using one way drops and passages. 39:07 However, if your game is all about providing freedom like ours, with little notion of punishing the player, allow them to switch between paths, but only at a cost, For example by making them decide whether they'd rather stay on the path they picked or try to sneak past a particularly deadly enemy.”
