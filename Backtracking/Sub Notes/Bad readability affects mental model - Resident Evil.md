# Bad readability affects mental model - Resident Evil
2024-01-14

How a room looks helps the player contextualize where this room could be in the level and thus makes it easy for the player to save and retrieve this information in their mental model. However, if the environment and the context stops being coherent, it affects the player's mental model, as it makes it difficult to save new information, which in turn lead to player wandering around aimlessly.

“the visual presentation of the environment provides a context that helps the player organize and encode the game world into a schema.” (Totten, 2017, p. 47)

“The visual images are distinct and easy enough to remember. However, when the context from room to room varies so wildly, the thread of coherence tying the game world together is frayed and the job of organizing the rooms into a schema becomes much more difficult. And without a sturdy mental model, it is easier to lose one’s bearings and play less assertively.” (Totten, 2017, p. 48)

“Remember, the mental model exists in the medium of space and so when the game presents a skewed form of space, the model too is distorted and therefore less reliable. The results? A compromised knowledge base, fewer informed decisions, and more aimless wandering.” (Totten, 2017, p. 48)

“The mishmash of visual settings, unclear division of floors, and exterior-looking interiors diminish the player’s ability to comprehend the environment.” (Totten, 2017, p. 49)
