# Ant Farm and Bad Readability - Resident Evil
2024-01-14

In chapter 8, Antarctica Transport Terminal, of Resident Evil Code Veronica there is an area called Ant Farm. It lies 5 floor under the ground. However, based on the paint and the design of the environment, it feels as if this is an exterior area.

Daniel Johnson, says that due the illusory nature of the environment, it becomes difficult to find a sense of coherence in the space.

“The Ant Farm exists five floors underground and yet has a floor and ceiling that extend out into the distance; the Upper Ant Farm, still underground, appears to exist at the edge of a precipice; and the Mansion Courtyard walls are painted blue to resemble a sky. The wallpapers create the illusion of indoor environments being set outdoors and thereby needlessly warp the player’s sense of spatial coherence.” (Totten, 2017, p. 48)
