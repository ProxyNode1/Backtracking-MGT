“Each connection that the player makes feels unique because of the time, place, and nature they encountered each lock and key.” (Totten, 2017, p. 37)

“One of the great mental pleasures of Resident Evil’s puzzle box comes from the tension between the timing and sequence that the player acquires certain knowledge and the timing and sequence that the lock and keys tease out this knowledge.” (Totten, 2017, p. 35)
