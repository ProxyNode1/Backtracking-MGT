# Personal Experience of the world through backtracking - Exploration
2024-01-28

As the player backtracks through a level in Resident Evil: Code Veronica, each connection they make about the locks and keys feel unique because of the specific time, place and nature of those locks and keys (Johnson, 2016). This gives players an advantage as they can use the previous knowledge to overcome challenges, not only adding to the sense of agency, but to the depth of gameplay as well. (Dormans, 2011)
