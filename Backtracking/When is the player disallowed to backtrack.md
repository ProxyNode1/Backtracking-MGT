	- “Items introduced in earlier levels can affect your map depending on whether the player chooses to use them. Elements introduced in later levels may also affect yours if the player is allowed to return later. Games often disallow “backtracking” or letting the player move backward through a level, for this very reason. It becomes difficult to know what the player will be equipped with, or capable of, at any point in your level when they can come or go at will throughout the game.” (Byrne, 2005, p. 168)
