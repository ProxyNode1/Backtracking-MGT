Where and when is the term backtracking applicable in the games?

The term, according to Cambridge Dictionary, is **to go back along a path that you have just followed.** Some of the examples where the player traverse the same path is.

1. Replaying the game.
2. Playing the level again but from back to front. eg, Halo 1, Destiny 2, Devil May Cry 4
3. Moving through the level as a part of the bounce. Backtracking in metroidvanias can also be considered as a bounce?
4. Moving along a path, complete an objective, move back along the same path towards next objective. Eg. Dishonored's The Golden Cat and The Flooded District, Deathloop's To and From Colt's Updaam Flat. 
5. Restarting the level from the beginning.


Replaying the same level to earn higher score, particularly in the games similar to Need for Speed and game modes such as time trails, does not fall into this category because, although the player character is traversing the same space, the line in which they move might be different.
