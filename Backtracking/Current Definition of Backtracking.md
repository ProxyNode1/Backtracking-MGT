# Current Definition of Backtracking
2024-01-28

Backtracking or Backtrack level flow in video games involves blocking the player's progression, commonly using a locked door, and, initially, giving them no means to open the door. Instead the player is asked to remember the door, and return to the blockage once they have required item or skill to open the locked door (Brandse, 2023). 

This is similar to Bounce (Bounce (Level Design) - Valve Developer Community). But unlike asking the player to remember the locked door and return to it with a way to unlock it, the door is organically introduced again to the player, as they follow the current path, but this time the player has the means to open the door.

Instead, it requires the player to remember these locked doors and return to them once the player has gained the required item or skill that allows the player to open the locked door and progress”
