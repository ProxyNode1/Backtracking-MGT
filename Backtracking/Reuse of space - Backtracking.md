# Reuse of space - Backtracking
2024-01-28

Video games are always limited by finite amount of resources whether they are technical limitations of hardware, the production schedule, or scope of the projects. So, it is the level designer's responsibility that they use every inch of spaces that have completely or multiple times, if possible, this is a reason that video games have backtracking. As, the reuse of space if economical and as the designer do not have to create new spaces for the video game.

	- “A video game always has a very finite amount of resources, whether that's the technical limitations of the hardware that you're developing on, such as the memory or the pixel, pushing power to the real world, constraints like your production schedule, the number of people on your team, the scope of your projects, and so on. 28:37 And it's a designer's responsibility to maximize the use of those resources. 28:42 And for level design, this means not only using the whole animal nerves to tail, but doing it more than once and doing it quickly.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 21)
	- “Modifiers are particularly important for creating bidirectional game play. 29:53 Now your level artists or world artists are going to spend a lot of time making the levels that you design look beautiful when the unfortunate reality is that most players will blitz through them in a matter of seconds. 30:06 Now, how do you keep your level artists happy and get the most bang for your art buck? 30:12 Well, you need to reuse the nice artwork from your level.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 22)
