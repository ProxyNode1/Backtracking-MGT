# Negative Player Feedback

- **Plenty** of backtracking.
    - Designers had no respect for the player's time. taking the piss and being a time sink in the most detrimental way possible.
      
- **Repetitive**. The problem is that most of the areas in the game have to be traversed a dozen times, each with multiple different characters. when every area repeats the same way of exploration and backtracking
    
- **Forced** to go back and forth. The dissatisfaction I feel when being forced to go back.
    
- Things were so stale and stagnant, and did not **changed**.
    
- **Boring and tedious** to go over old ground. Incredibly tedious backtracking with no fast travel option. Backtracking because the next area to progress is on the other side of the map.
    
- **Padding**. Pointless filler that doesn’t add anything to the experience. Artificially extending game time.
    
- Missions are just playing existing levels and strikes **in reverse**
    
- **Confusing and unclear.** I get so lost in it, thus backtracking a lot. I can't tell you how many dead ends I went down only to have to spin around and go back the way I came.
    
- **Breaks the immersion and tension.** Game loses its horror atmosphere and suspense when the player has to backtrack through familiar and safe areas. You get used to the environment and the enemies, and you lose the sense of fear and danger.
    
- **Backtracking is unnecessary and poorly designed.**
    
- **Lack of guidance.** The lack of objective markers will often have you searching through empty corridors long enough to push your patience to the limit. Frustrating to remember which map had items locked behind which movement ability.
    
- Lazy design or general sign of cutting corners
    
- if I'm back tracking just so I can unlock a gate or some other hurdle, I'm much less forgiving of the mechanic. Just backtracking to accomplish one or two things can get a bit irritating.
    
- People that approach optional boss fights as mandatory. Backtracking to collect mandatory things at the end of the game.
