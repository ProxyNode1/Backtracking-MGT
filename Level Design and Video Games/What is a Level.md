2024-01-10



**The “building blocks” we need are these:** 
- Concept 
- Environment to exist in
- Beginning
- Ending
- Goal
- Challenge to overcome between the player and the goal
- Reward
- Way of handling failure


Levels in video games, at the most basic, environments for gameplay. It has physical boundaries, similar to an environment, but it also has a starting point, an end point, an entry, an exit and a goal or multiple goals for the player, says (Byrne, 2005). Usually these elements are combined to evoke certain mood in the player. (Kayali, Ortner, 2016).

In many games, the term "Level" is synonymous with map, mission, and stage. (Byrne, 2005)

Levels in some of the video games either focus on a specific, often unique, activities, such as boss fight or they contain all of the game's systems, for example boroughs in grand theft auto 3.

Level are also used to provide breaks between key story locations. Adding story to the level also enhances the quality of the level. The story can be utilized to give players crucial information about the threats and their goals in the level, for example the game of chess can be looked as war between two kings, and to win the war, the player has to defeat king on the opposite side.
Apart from story, environment, and goals, the challenges, rewards and failures are also the building blocks of a level.

	- “A story can enhance a level and give the players information about what they are expected to do, what they might need to avoid or seek out, and so on. However, many types of games exist without a narrative element, and leave it to the players to create a story if they really need one. Chess, for example, has elements of medieval war and politics—castles and knights and bishops on a playing field eliminating each other.” (Byrne, 2005, p. 40)
