# What is Level Design


As Levels in video games have multiple components, level design is a composite role that brings together multiple disciplines such as art, design, and engineering (Byrne, 2005) (Kayali, Ortner, 2016).

Designing a level involves crafting an environment where the player can experience interesting encounters, revelations, and rewards (Milam & El Nasr, 2010). Encounters, revelations, and rewards are built around the video game and its core mechanics, and level designer uses these elements as building blocks to create a level to play with these elements (Kayali, Ortner, 2016). Level design also aims to combine game elements, and actions to deliver mastery over the game.

Although, the level design is an important, it is also an elusive aspect of game  development (Milam & El Nasr, 2010).
