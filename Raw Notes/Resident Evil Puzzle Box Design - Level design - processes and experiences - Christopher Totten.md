“What engages the players of Resident Evil is the puzzle box environment and the mental models, planning, and execution required to solve it.” (Totten, 2017, p. 20)

---

“In real-time action games such as Resident Evil, knowledge of the game world and the dexterity, reflex, and timing needed to defend oneself against enemies are both essential sets of skills, and different players will strike a different balance between the two.” (Totten, 2017, p. 21)

--- 

“we are focusing almost exclusively on the mental challenges that take place in the player’s mind.” (Totten, 2017, p. 21)

---

“barriers put in the player’s path (locks) and what must be done to overcome them (keys)” (Totten, 2017, p. 21)

---

“The relationship between the key (player actions used to defeat the enemies) and the lock (barriers) allows the designers to establish the core gameplay, in this case combat.” (Totten, 2017, p. 21)

---

“In Resident Evil, two forms of locks engineer player progression: item locks and boss battles.” (Totten, 2017, p. 21)

---

“Resident Evil’s moment to moment gameplay tends to be dictated by item locks and keys more so than boss battles, which are few in number.” (Totten, 2017, p. 22)

---

“Deducing that the blue key opens the blue door hardly qualifies as a test of knowledge skills—neither are putting the square-handled crank in a square-shaped hole or using an ice pick to clear a keyhole blockage. Resident Evil dilutes most of the challenge out of the key-lock process and uses it simply as a function of having the player crisscross (i.e., explore) the game world.” (Totten, 2017, p. 22)

---

“The same template serves Super Metroid, Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, and the legion of Metroidvania Kickstarter projects in their wake.” (Totten, 2017, p. 22)

---

“These games, like Resident Evil, are about exploring an interconnected space through a series of locks and keys that prompt movement through the game world.” (Totten, 2017, p. 22) *It is about exploration from the mental challenge's perspective.*

---

“If item keys and item locks, which move the player back and forth across the game world, are the mechanisms of progression, then what exactly is involved in this process, the core gameplay, beyond simply deducing which key fits which lock?” (Totten, 2017, p. 22)

---

“In order to complete a Resident Evil game, one needs to play so as to minimize risk.” (Totten, 2017, p. 22)

---

“They account for space in their inventory when entering a new area and plan their save room pit stops to avoid backtracking for supplies.” (Totten, 2017, p. 22) Backtracking can be used to allow players to make strategic plans.

---

“know which rooms hold locks, which rooms hold resources, which rooms hold enemies, and which routes are possible and therefore the safest and shortest to their destination are at an advantage. Resident Evil is a game of mental frameworks, where success hinges on the player’s ability to build a working model of the game world in their head.” (Totten, 2017, p. 23)

(Totten, 2017, p. 23) Is it possible for the player to even know about this on their first run of the game? 

Enemies respawn in RE1.

---

“When faced with limited resources, a high threat of failure, and the interconnection of locks and keys spread across the environment, there exists a strong impetus to put whatever relevant information one can obtain from the game world to use.” (Totten, 2017, p. 23)

---

“According to Miller’s law,1 human beings are only able to remember 7 ± 2 bits of information in their working memory, about as much important data a player would encounter in their first 10 minutes of play (rooms, relative positions of rooms, routes, keys, locks, ammo, enemies, save rooms, etc.).” (Totten, 2017, p. 23)

---

“Rooms, as the smallest integer of a game world, are the foundation of my mental model. As I play, I store each room in my mind as a snapshot of the backdrop.” (Totten, 2017, p. 23)

---

“The realistic settings of Resident Evil maps, where each room and the contents within are defined by utility, makes it easy to attach keys, locks, resources, and enemies to each image.” (Totten, 2017, p. 23)

---

“Reliance on certain rooms and routes adds depth to the model as favor and hierarchy pull certain images to the front of my mind while pushing others into the corners.” (Totten, 2017, p. 24)

---

“One of the tensions that the Resident Evil games thrive on is that few players are able to retain enough information or recall the right information to make informed choices all the time. At some point they will be caught short and forced to walk blindly into the unknown.” (Totten, 2017, p. 24)

---

“What the discussion so far has demonstrated, though, is that the survival elements of Resident Evil increase the significance of decision making and thereby increase the potency of knowledge as a dynamic force that underpins player actions.” (Totten, 2017, p. 25)

---

“The complex constellation of variables, their interrelatedness, and the depth of potential outcomes makes it difficult for the player to foresee the impacts of their decisions.” (Totten, 2017, p. 25)

---

“Since consequence cannot easily be measured, solutions can’t be optimized, and so when presented with choice, no one course of action appears better than the others: there are only options.” (Totten, 2017, p. 25)

---

“Given the weight of each decision, the frequency at which players encounter them, and the way choices ripple forward in time to affect subsequent choices, players are able to mold their own unique survival horror experience out of Resident Evil’s gameplay.” (Totten, 2017, p. 26)

---

“The environmental storytelling is not merely window dressing, though. As we know, mental models are built on linkages between individual pieces of knowledge: the more connected the information, the stronger the memory network.” (Totten, 2017, p. 27)

---

“The narrative details shared through the environment provide the player with context that helps them organize their schema and elaborate information into their long-term memory.” (Totten, 2017, p. 27)

---

“That is, we intuitively use the narrative clues provided to us to craft our own stories (mnemonics) that aid in the memorization process.” (Totten, 2017, p. 27)

---

“By the end of a Resident Evil game, the player is likely to feel a strong connection with the game world because they have come to internalize it as part of their play experience” (Totten, 2017, p. 27)

---

“Resident Evil 2 is a series of self-contained chapters completed one at a time, with some backtracking to previous areas.” (Totten, 2017, p. 27)

“Resident Evil 0’s level design is characterized by the dynamics of separating, joining, and managing items between Billy and Rebecca.” (Totten, 2017, p. 27)

---

“We will track how the game designers scaffold the player’s awareness of the game world, challenge them to draw connections, and upset their familiarity in unexpected ways.” (Totten, 2017, p. 28)

---

“The extra resources come at the expense of being distracted from the main thread of progression and having to retain important information for a longer period of time. Along the same lines, if key clues are overlooked or forgotten, players have the freedom to backtrack and fill any holes. This backtracking is not necessarily a waste of time as all observation feeds into the underlying knowledge game and strengthens the model. Today’s backtracker may be rewarded the knowledge to make them tomorrow’s assertive player. 
These two points, the Barracks and the backtracker, may seem inconsequential, but they demonstrate the subtle ways in which the player’s decisions determine the flow of information and thereby shape their mental model.” (Totten, 2017, p. 30) Imp

---

“The locks and keys see the player traverse the length of the Prison four times before they leave. The backtracking teaches players that enemies and resources have permanence and do not disappear or respawn once the player leaves the room.” (Totten, 2017, p. 31) Imp

---

“The Prison tutorial can be thought of as a miniaturization of Claire’s main adventures on Rockfort. The initial information-gathering period (the linear walk) and the subsequent pursuit of active leads (the complex lock)—the tutorial’s two halves—correspond to this chapter, “Building the Foundation,” and the subsequent chapter, “Testing the Model.”” (Totten, 2017, p. 31)

---

“As they progress, the player slowly develops the foundation of their model, which will not be put to use until after the intermission that divides “Building the Foundation” and “Testing the Model.”” (Totten, 2017, p. 31)

---

“Although the single thread of locks and keys orients players toward the main path (the Steering Wheel in the Palace grants access to the Airport and the Biohazard Card in the Airport unlocks the main throughway in the Training Facility), the great expansion of available environments allows the player to deviate more freely.” (Totten, 2017, p. 31)

---

“Variability exists at both a macro and micro level. At a macro level, the player can ignore (or overlook!) the key-lock sequence and explore the three areas out of order (i.e., go to the Training Facility before the Palace or return to the Palace after exploring the Airport). At a micro level, they can explore the wealth of optional resource rooms within each of the environments, much like the Barracks in the Prison. Figures 2.4 and 2.5, which contrast the optional rooms (dark gray) against the mandatory key-lock route (light gray), give a sense of the available micro-level options and overall bump in game world size. With more freedom, the game designers hand over more responsibility to the player to manage their bearings in the new environment and keep an active checklist of potential leads.” (Totten, 2017, p. 31)

---

“The freedom to explore by oneself is also the freedom to wander aimlessly.” (Totten, 2017, p. 31)

---

“Rather, freedom is carefully controlled to increase autonomy while minimizing wandering.” (Totten, 2017, p. 33)

---

“The player is also not yet asked to travel back and forth between the main areas either, which helps to distinguish the three categories in one’s mind.” (Totten, 2017, p. 33)

---

“Organizing the model and encoding details into one’s long-term memory is therefore an easier process than if the environments were a contextual jumble and the main thread of progression were less straightforward.” (Totten, 2017, p. 33)

---

“Trimming this excess from the model lightens the overall mental load. And so the system” (Totten, 2017, p. 33)

---

“implicitly rewards players who are comprehensive in their exploration and show initiative in maintaining their knowledge base.” (Totten, 2017, p. 34)

(Totten, 2017, p. 34) What does it mean by juncture, here?

---

“By having the player pass through the save rooms and move between floors and between the front and back sides of the Palace and Training Facility, the game is not just familiarizing the player with the building blocks of the new environments, but they are modeling the paths and pit stops that they will be using when putting keys to lock in the “Testing the Model” chapter.” (Totten, 2017, p. 34)

---

“Frequently visited rooms harden into long-term memory, less visited rooms are pushed into the background, and resource rooms mined of their worth are removed.” (Totten, 2017, p. 34)

---

“This is where the decay of retention and the associated tension creep into the gameplay.” (Totten, 2017, p. 35)

---

“One of the great mental pleasures of Resident Evil’s puzzle box comes from the tension between the timing and sequence that the player acquires certain knowledge and the timing and sequence that the lock and keys tease out this knowledge.” (Totten, 2017, p. 35)

---

“Each connection that the player makes feels unique because of the time, place, and nature they encountered each lock and key.” (Totten, 2017, p. 37)

---

“Gameplay thus far have been replaced by a sprawling network of branches. The freedom provided by the structure places further responsibility on the player to manage their progress. The game takes a number of steps to ease the player into their new responsibilities, though.” (Totten, 2017, p. 37)

---

“The complete autonomy and lack of familiarity with the transport terminal encourage the player to systematically sweep the environment for clues—something that was useful earlier, but is more or less a requirement from here on out.” (Totten, 2017, p. 38)

---

“forcing the player to rewire their neural networks to accommodate the designers’ reinterpretation of the building.” (Totten, 2017, p. 38)

---

“Despite initial appearances, this is not a true return to Rockfort Island. Chris is limited to the Training Facility and Airport, the latter of which remains identical to how the player last left it, albeit with a fresh smattering of undead workmen.” (Totten, 2017, p. 38)

---

“many of the changes were foreshadowed in the series of cut-scenes* leading into Claire and Steve’s escape” (Totten, 2017, p. 40)

---

“The return to the Training Facility and the variety of changes that come with it force the player to once again reevaluate their mental model. This time, though, their conception of the facility is further entrenched in their long-term memory and the process of reconciling the differences is much more complicated. These two characteristics define the knowledge game in “Revising the Structure.”” (Totten, 2017, p. 41)

---

“In “Revising the Structure,” all the changes, as listed above, pertain to the structure of the building and therefore the player’s ability to move through it.” (Totten, 2017, p. 41)

---

“Where “Testing the Model” is transformational in being additive to the player’s mental model, “Revising the Structure” is transformational in reinterpreting the model.” (Totten, 2017, p. 42)

---

“As with “Testing the Model,” the new details are teased out as the player encounters them. It is a slow overhaul as players reacquaint themselves with the new environment, works out the mental kinks into their model, and discovers new opportunities in the process.” (Totten, 2017, p. 42)

---

“By controlling the flow of information, the game designers can create intrigue and anticipation.” (Totten, 2017, p. 42)

---

“Players’ reinterpretation of the Training Facility is supported by the unused locks and keys from their previous escapades on Rockfort as Claire.” (Totten, 2017, p. 42)

---

“Parallels can be drawn with the slow increase in player freedom over the “Tutorial,” “Building the Foundation,” and “Testing the Model” chapters, but it is not quite that simple, as the player is able to splinter off from the linear path a few clicks into the proceedings (Figure 2.8, white arrows)” (Totten, 2017, p. 44)

---

“The linear sequence completes Rodrigo’s story arc, resources Chris with a small kit of supplies, directs the player to the save room, and introduces them to the previously inaccessible southern side of the basement. By restricting player freedom, this initial preparation is quick and seamless.” (Totten, 2017, p. 44)

---

“The smaller areas and few crossing paths makes the available options easier to read.” (Totten, 2017, p. 44)

---

“Their mental model, a culmination of their individual decisions, observations, and encoded information, is the compass that guides progression.” (Totten, 2017, p. 35)

---

“From the pedagogical perspective of this analysis, a good video game finale combines the assortment of gameplay concepts into one last megachallenge befitting of the skills and knowledge the player has gained on their quest to mastery.” (Totten, 2017, p. 44)

---

“its environments lack the visual and spatial coherence that has made the model building in the rest of the game rather seamless, leading to a somewhat confounding and potentially bitter conclusion.” (Totten, 2017, p. 44)

---

“Steve flooded the second basement floor with water, which has since frozen over and left Chris with a rejuvenated environment to explore.” (Totten, 2017, p. 45)

---

(Totten, 2017, p. 45) Out of all the previously explored areas during claire's run, only a handlful of them remain accessible.

---

“The optional supply rooms remain and have seen some changes that invite a return engagement. For example, the cage housing the duralumin case in the Tool Storeroom has been split open.” (Totten, 2017, p. 45)

---

“The frozen water discards a large chunk of the environment and opens up access to the untouched lower levels of the terminal, largely sidestepping Claire’s earlier run.” (Totten, 2017, p. 45)

---

“The unused locks and keys facilitate smoother key-lock connections and lead to some extra supplies.” (Totten, 2017, p. 46)

---

“most of the player’s prior knowledge can be discarded with little consequence.” (Totten, 2017, p. 46)


---

“If Claire was never poisoned, then the serum will not exist and the full motion video prompting the switch over to Claire will directly follow the initial cut-scene.” (Totten, 2017, p. 46)

---

“The Queen Ant Report file in the room opposite Alexia’s Lab foreshadows the position of the serum, assuming the player comes across it beforehand.” (Totten, 2017, p. 46)

---

“As with the other Resident Evil games, Code Veronica employs a hands-off approach to player choice, allowing decision making to function as a component of gameplay. A subbranch initiated unknowingly by player action is therefore something of an anomaly but a variation on the branching progression design nonetheless.” (Totten, 2017, p. 46)

---

“These latter two developments in the branching structure design subvert two established assumptions: that the player can freely move between strings (active leads in the player’s mind) and that each sequence of keys and locks is independent of the others.* Getting a sense for the underlying progression structure is therefore much more challenging than in any of the earlier chapters.” (Totten, 2017, p. 46)

---

“The key-lock system that underpins the player’s progression operates on player knowledge of the game world. The more one knows about their environment (i.e., the richer their mental model), the more quickly and safely they can unlock the barriers in their path.” (Totten, 2017, p. 47)

---

“If they then free Claire, assuming she’s not poisoned, they’ll be locked into the Detention Center for Alexia’s thread (Figure 2.9, gray box) development of their mental model will likely be interrupted for a period of time. The player must leave an unfinished model and go on to piece together a separate model before they can return to the original.” (Totten, 2017, p. 47)

---

“it creates a tension by sidelining the player from the main task for a duration of time.” (Totten, 2017, p. 47)

---

“the interval in “Searching for Coherence” disrupts the one yet unfinished section of gameplay. The timing of the interruption, or even whether or not it occurs, is also player-determined.” (Totten, 2017, p. 47)

---

“the visual presentation of the environment provides a context that helps the player organize and encode the game world into a schema.” (Totten, 2017, p. 47)

---

“The visual images are distinct and easy enough to remember. However, when the context from room to room varies so wildly, the thread of coherence tying the game world together is frayed and the job of organizing the rooms into a schema becomes much more difficult. And without a sturdy mental model, it is easier to lose one’s bearings and play less assertively.” (Totten, 2017, p. 48)

---

“The other dimension to this issue is the skewed representation of floors. The elevator that connects the corridor with the scanners and the Mansion Courtyard (i.e., the left-hand entrance of the upside-down T) drops the player four stories, from B1 to B5. This is the only time in the game where an elevator moves more than one floor without informing the player. Sure, the time spent taking the elevator is longer than usual, but I don’t think that this in and of itself is a sufficient tell, especially when you consider the random handful of doors that have longer-than-usual opening animations. If the player works within the assumptions presented, a number of contradictions reveal themselves. But even if we disregard the poor communication of the elevator, it’s not hard to be confounded by the logic of the underground environments.” (Totten, 2017, p. 48)

---

“The Ant Farm exists five floors underground and yet has a floor and ceiling that extend out into the distance; the Upper Ant Farm, still underground, appears to exist at the edge of a precipice; and the Mansion Courtyard walls are painted blue to resemble a sky. The wallpapers create the illusion of indoor environments being set outdoors and thereby needlessly warp the player’s sense of spatial coherence.” (Totten, 2017, p. 48)

---

“Remember, the mental model exists in the medium of space and so when the game presents a skewed form of space, the model too is distorted and therefore less reliable. The results? A compromised knowledge base, fewer informed decisions, and more aimless wandering.” (Totten, 2017, p. 48)

---

“A theme that has underlined the chapter-by-chapter analysis is the reduction of scaffolding as the player’s ability develops and challenge increases.” (Totten, 2017, p. 48)

---

“The mishmash of visual settings, unclear division of floors, and exterior-looking interiors diminish the player’s ability to comprehend the environment.” (Totten, 2017, p. 49)

---

“Code Veronica’s use of scaffolding and mental model construction, we have given form to the knowledge game that occurs in the player’s head and the invisible dialog between game designer (teacher) and player (student).” (Totten, 2017, p. 49)

---

“In the early goings, accessible rooms are few and the order in which the player can explore them are fewer. The limitations quiet the player and focus their attention on learning the game’s mechanics and systems.” (Totten, 2017, p. 49)

---

“As the game opens up, freedom is delivered in two forms: space and sequence. The player is given access to large portions of the game world and the single thread of progression unravels into a system of branching paths.” (Totten, 2017, p. 49)

---

“Clear prompts leading into each branch offer the player entry points and options, while a suggested sequence guides their progress, obfuscating much of the structural complexity.” (Totten, 2017, p. 49)

---

---

“With more freedom comes more choice, and therefore more opportunities to shape the play experience. The lift of freedom, however, is counterbalanced with the weight of responsibility. The player must manage their own learning, which places more of an emphasis on using their knowledge base (i.e., their mental model) to make smart decisions.” (Totten, 2017, p. 50)

---

“Being able to apply the skills and knowledge gained so far in freer contexts allows players to take ownership over their learning.” (Totten, 2017, p. 50)

---

“Direct pedagogic devices (e.g., controlling the sequence in which the player can explore the game world) become less direct (e.g., revisiting environments, where the player can use their prior experience in the area as a scaffold) and are eventually replaced with subtle guides (e.g., contextual suggestion through cut-scenes and text files). The game designer’s guiding hand is always present, but it shifts and transforms to meet the evolving needs of the gameplay.” (Totten, 2017, p. 50)

---

“The player’s decisions ripple forward in time as knowledge, resources, and enemies are suspended across moments of play.” (Totten, 2017, p. 50)

---

“By having the player explore altered environments with their old mental floor plans, the game brings prior learning and new learning into contrast.” (Totten, 2017, p. 50)

---

“Each moment of learning informs our understanding of the world and through this understanding we shape our reality.” (Totten, 2017, p. 51)

---

“In Code Veronica, the player’s reality is their mental model and the gameplay experience is the medium through which the strengths and weaknesses of their learning and the need to reconsider one’s reality are realized.” (Totten, 2017, p. 51)

---

“The intersections between these two threads, as well as Steve’s intermission, create distance between the main links in the branches, which sustains the challenge of recall.” (Totten, 2017, p. 51)
