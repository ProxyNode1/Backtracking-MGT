##### Notes:

“The directional quality and flow of the space defined by parallel planes are naturally manifested in spaces used for circulation and movement, such as the streets and boulevards of towns and cities.” (Ching, 2007, p. 161)

“The flow of the space defined by parallel planes corresponds naturally to the paths of movement within a building, along its corridors, halls, and galleries.” (Ching, 2007, p. 162)

“If the end of a long, narrow field is open, the space will encourage movement and induce a progression or sequence of events.” (Ching, 2007, p. 166)

The pattern of circulation and movement within a centralized organization may be radial, loop, or spiral in form.” (Ching, 2007, p. 212)

“ The path of our movement can be conceived as the perceptual thread that links the spaces of a building, or any series of interior or exterior spaces, together."  (Ching, 2007, p. 255)

"Since we move in Time through a Sequence of Spaces, we experience a space in relation to where we’ve been and where we anticipate going.” (Ching, 2007, p. 255)

“This is the first phase of the circulation system, during which we are prepared to see, experience, and use the spaces within a building” (Ching, 2007, p. 257)

“All paths of movement, whether of people, cars, goods, or services, are linear in nature. And all paths have a starting point, from which we are taken through a sequence of spaces to our destination.” (Ching, 2007, p. 279)

“contour” (Ching, 2007, p. 279) Shape

“Pedestrians, on the other hand, although able to tolerate abrupt changes in direction, require a greater volume of space than their bodily dimensions and greater freedom of choice along a path.” (Ching, 2007, p. 279)

“The intersection or crossing of paths is always a point of decision-making for the person approaching it. The continuity and scale of each path at an intersection can help us distinguish between major routes leading to major spaces and secondary paths leading to lesser spaces.” (Ching, 2007, p. 279)

“promenades” (Ching, 2007, p. 279) a paved public walk, typically one along the seafront at a resort.

“The nature of the configuration of a path both influences and is influenced by the organizational pattern of the spaces it links. 
The configuration of a path may reinforce a spatial organization by paralleling its pattern, or the configuration may contrast with the form of the spatial organization and serve as a visual counter point to it. 
Once we are able to map out in our minds the overall configuration of the paths in a building, our orientation within the building and our understanding of its spatial layout will be made clear.” (Ching, 2007, p. 279)

“Important points in any pattern are centers of activity, entrances to rooms and halls, and places for vertical circulation provided by stairways, ramps, and elevators.” (Ching, 2007, p. 280)

“These nodes punctuate the paths of movement through a building and provide opportunities for pause, rest, and reorientation.” (Ching, 2007, p. 280)

"To avoid the creation of a disorienting maze, a hierarchical order among the paths and nodes of a building should be established by differentiating their scale, form, length, and placement.” (Ching, 2007, p. 280)

“The form and scale of a circulation space, however, should accommodate the movement of people as they promenade, pause, rest, or take in a view along a path.” (Ching, 2007, p. 297)

“The width and height of a circulation space should be proportionate with the type and amount of movement it must handle.” (Ching, 2007, p. 298)

“A narrow, enclosed path naturally encourages forward motion.” (Ching, 2007, p. 298)

“To accommodate more traffic as well as to create spaces for pausing, resting, or viewing, sections of a path can be widened.” (Ching, 2007, p. 298)

“Within a large space, a path can be random, without form or definition, and be determined by the activities and arrangement of furnishings within the space.” (Ching, 2007, p. 298)

“Stairs and stairways provide for our vertical movement between the levels of a building or outdoor space.” (Ching, 2007, p. 301)

“If steep, a stair can make ascent physically tiring as well as psychologically forbidding, and can make descent precarious. If shallow, a stair must have treads deep enough to fit our stride.” (Ching, 2007, p. 301)

“The width of a stairway also provides a visual clue to the public or private nature of the stairway. Wide, shallow steps can serve as an invitation, while a narrow, steep stairway can lead to more private places.” (Ching, 2007, p. 301)

“Landings interrupt the run of a stair and enable it to change direction. Landings also provide opportunities for rest and possibilities for access and outlook from the stairway.” (Ching, 2007, p. 301)
