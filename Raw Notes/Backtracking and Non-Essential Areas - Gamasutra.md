“For a very long time, backtracking has been seen as a cheap way to lengthen games. If you are out of time, money, or story, you have a twitching desire to send the player back to places they have already visited to find something you couldn’t get to or do the first time around(Retro did this with missile expansions in the Metroid Prime series).” (“Backtracking and Non-Essential Areas.pdf”, p. 3)

“Forcing the player to do things not essential to the main path down the middle of the game will make the experience less enjoyable.” (“Backtracking and Non-Essential Areas.pdf”, p. 3)

“In Metroid Prime: Corruption, near the end, you come to a door that requires six or so missile expansions to open. You have to go to old areas you have already visited and devour them for missile expansions and doors that were locked the first time you walked by them. You even have to defeat some enemies and puzzles you beat the first time.” (“Backtracking and Non-Essential Areas.pdf”, p. 3)

“When forcing a backtracking segment, no new challenges are thrown at the player! The learning curve and pacing that has carried the player throughout the game is suddenly cut and halted until you find these missile expansions.” (“Backtracking and Non-Essential Areas.pdf”, p. 3)

(“Backtracking and Non-Essential Areas.pdf”, p. 3) Constantly learning. One of the ten principles of good level design.

“frustration consumes the player, who has no clear objective and path to the objective,” (“Backtracking and Non-Essential Areas.pdf”, p. 3)

(“Backtracking and Non-Essential Areas.pdf”, p. 3) Is that due to the design or poor guidance?

“The truth is: if the player wanted to explore, he/she would have! If you allow the player to either charge through the level or check every nook and cranny, the players who just want to advance the story do so, and those who want to explore the world do so. And not everyone feels the same way throughout the game!” (“Backtracking and Non-Essential Areas.pdf”, p. 4)

(“Backtracking and Non-Essential Areas.pdf”, p. 4) Forcing the players into a way of play that their playstyle may not align with

“When I played Fallout 3, there were times where I scoured areas for little things to do, and there were times I put the blinders up and went straight forward, depending on how I felt (self-adjusted pacing).” (“Backtracking and Non-Essential Areas.pdf”, p. 4)

“By exploring the worlds of Mass Effect 2 or meeting all the deranged survivors of Fallout 3, the player can nearly DOUBLE his/her playtime! That is a whole lot of extra content. But another important detail – Fallout 3 and Mass Effect 2 didn’t really need to force you to backtrack anyways to see all there was to see: the worlds were so interesting that I actually WANTED to see what there was to do.” (“Backtracking and Non-Essential Areas.pdf”, p. 4)

“if these two games forced me to explore and find hidden collectables in far reach corners of levels, I wouldn’t have wanted to explore! At that point, it is not really exploration – the best kind of exploration in games doesn’t force you to do so (but I’ll save that for another article).” (“Backtracking and Non-Essential Areas.pdf”, p. 4)

“If I, however, told you before the article started that I was going to test you afterwards on what was written in the parentheses, the reading would have become a task!” (“Backtracking and Non-Essential Areas.pdf”, p. 4)

“The player gets a grand sense of accomplishment upon discovering something new that he/she knows (or at least believes) very few people have discovered.” (“Backtracking and Non-Essential Areas.pdf”, p. 5)

“Extra content also personalizes the experience of the player. When the game is complete, the player has something he/she can look back on, something different than what any other player experienced.” (“Backtracking and Non-Essential Areas.pdf”, p. 5)

“So if you want to force exploration on the player to make him/her explore all of the world you created, DON’T! You will make it more special to the players who actually want to explore the world you created (and if it is as good as you believe, they will; forceful exploration is a band aid over faults of a dull story, world, characters, etc.).” (“Backtracking and Non-Essential Areas.pdf”, p. 6)

“You should only use backtracking if it is necessary in giving the player a strong set of emotions or a new, truly unique challenge.” (“Backtracking and Non-Essential Areas.pdf”, p. 6)

“Simply, something needs to have changed since the last time you were there, something major. Otherwise, it is just a waste of time, and will be regarded as such.” (“Backtracking and Non-Essential Areas.pdf”, p. 6)

“while giving the players who actually cared, the completionists and those who had been sucked into the world of Metroid, the green light to even more content. Logical?” (“Backtracking and Non-Essential Areas.pdf”, p. 7)
