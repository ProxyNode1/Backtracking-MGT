### My Questions:
- Was there an assumption that the Player will take a path and stick to it.
- Why call it exploration beat and not payoff (or follow through) beat?
- Are they trying to enchant the player to progress, what if the player wants to check out the other paths, allow or disallow, why?
- Was making people miss out, an intention?


“My hope with this talk is that I can provide you guys with some insights into the level design of Cyberpunk and in the end a better understanding and a concrete set of principles of how to create nonlinear levels that give each player, no matter which path they pick, a more special experience.” (“Level Design Summit - Benefits of Missing Out - What 'Cyberpunk 2077' Taught Us About Non-Linear Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 1)

“However, highly ambitious as we were, we couldn't help but notice some criticism that kept coming up. 15:01 One was that players didn't really feel like whatever play style they picked mattered that much.” (“Level Design Summit - Benefits of Missing Out - What 'Cyberpunk 2077' Taught Us About Non-Linear Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 9)

“We see that as soon as the player actually moves from the Golden Path, they are bound to run into some cool things. 21:59 This is a cool way to reward players with unique experience, but it also means that depending on which path you pick and what you find there, the information the player has about the world can be slightly different.” (“Level Design Summit - Benefits of Missing Out - What 'Cyberpunk 2077' Taught Us About Non-Linear Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 13)

“In an effort to make sure that players would experience the best possible narrative, we often would put the coolest and most important things following the generic path, because this way we could make sure all players would be able to experience it.” (“Level Design Summit - Benefits of Missing Out - What 'Cyberpunk 2077' Taught Us About Non-Linear Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 13)

“And it's incredible, and highlights how sometimes the cost of enhancing the value of invested skills for the player could be quite low. 26:21 Imagine if we had chosen to do it the other way around and treat this side passage as the generic path with a gym being unlocked by a skill check. 26:29 That way your skill check would have unlocked an awesome new section for you, rewarding you with a cool and unique experience to summarize our issues.” (“Level Design Summit - Benefits of Missing Out - What 'Cyberpunk 2077' Taught Us About Non-Linear Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 16)

“oftentimes we would add reward to the challenge generic should provide by also making it the path with a cool bespoke experience. 27:02 To fulfill our goal to present a great story, we tended to cluster all our cool content related to exposition, lore, cool encounters, secrets, and sometimes even loot at bottlenecks in the level like in the end. 27:16 That in by itself is not such a big problem actually, if you only want to create a cool cinematic narrative experience. 27:25 However, looking at it from the perspective of creating memorable nonlinear experiences in game play, it's hard to give real value to play styles with this approach.” (“Level Design Summit - Benefits of Missing Out - What 'Cyberpunk 2077' Taught Us About Non-Linear Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 16)

“This beat, Discovery, is primarily about the player discovering their options, making their choices, and overcoming challenges.” (“Level Design Summit - Benefits of Missing Out - What 'Cyberpunk 2077' Taught Us About Non-Linear Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 18)

“Once the player made their choice and successfully passed through the discovery area, they now find themselves in our exploration beat, and the exploration beat provides a more intimate and linear experience compared to discovery. 31:04 It does this by narrowing down the level and what the player can see of the rest of the location, restricting them to the path they have chosen. 31:13 The intent is to let the player focus on exploring and experiencing the choice they committed to, and this beat is less about making new choices and much more about the consequence of choosing. 31:27 It's the payoff for having chosen Now this is the moment for some cool, intimate experiences, World building, puzzles, special encounters, secrets, expanding on the context of the level's narrative, whatever you can think of to make this cool.” (“Level Design Summit - Benefits of Missing Out - What 'Cyberpunk 2077' Taught Us About Non-Linear Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 18)

“Discovery is all about providing choices and presenting the player with promises of the awesome that they're about to uncover.” (“Level Design Summit - Benefits of Missing Out - What 'Cyberpunk 2077' Taught Us About Non-Linear Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 18)

“Exploration is where that awesome lives. 32:02 It's the player experiencing the consequences of their choice of picking a path, and for doing so, exploration rewards the player. 32:12 It's not only great from the player's perspective, but also from ours as storytellers. 32:18 This structure allows us to still expose the player to important narrative elements and cinematic moments, while giving the individual player a more unique experience.” (“Level Design Summit - Benefits of Missing Out - What 'Cyberpunk 2077' Taught Us About Non-Linear Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 19)

“Due to my research, I do genuinely think it is OK for players to miss cool things if they do it, and only if they do it by experiencing other cool stuff. 32:52 Basically, keeping the net gain for the player in balance, let's look at how that concept might look like applied to our level, the Brain Dance Studio.” (“Level Design Summit - Benefits of Missing Out - What 'Cyberpunk 2077' Taught Us About Non-Linear Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 19)

“This is a bit of an extreme example, but even though the player has a choice here, does it really feel like a choice worth making? 34:30 The proximity of these two entrances leaves little room for mystery as to whether these paths are actually any different.” (“Level Design Summit - Benefits of Missing Out - What 'Cyberpunk 2077' Taught Us About Non-Linear Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 20)

“What happens is that even when we apply vertical distance to a path, as long as the paths are close to each other, they're still perceived as the same path because the proximity results in them running vertically parallel to each other. 35:05 And in part to this, the exploration bead fails to provide meaningful rewards by making each choice result in a very similar payoff.” (“Level Design Summit - Benefits of Missing Out - What 'Cyberpunk 2077' Taught Us About Non-Linear Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 21)

“Principle 2:  Perception of Exclusivity, prevents them from knowing the alternative outcome and heightens a sense of wonder. 37:57 The more exclusive and isolated a path feels, the more special it can become in the player's mind. 38:02 Without a perception of exclusivity, we destroy all chances of players to even wonder whether another path might result in a different outcome.” (“Level Design Summit - Benefits of Missing Out - What 'Cyberpunk 2077' Taught Us About Non-Linear Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 22)

“Through perception of exclusivity, we can also allow a player to fully focus on the experience provided from the path they picked, and this in turn heightens a player's curiosity about the possible alternative outcomes they could have experienced.” (“Level Design Summit - Benefits of Missing Out - What 'Cyberpunk 2077' Taught Us About Non-Linear Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 23)

“Furthermore, to fully allow the player to focus on the path, commit them to a choice by using one way drops and passages. 39:07 However, if your game is all about providing freedom like ours, with little notion of punishing the player, allow them to switch between paths, but only at a cost, For example by making them decide whether they'd rather stay on the path they picked or try to sneak past a particularly deadly enemy.” (“Level Design Summit - Benefits of Missing Out - What 'Cyberpunk 2077' Taught Us About Non-Linear Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 23)
