“because we have spend a lot of time analyzing the levels in season one, we discovered that you kinda need to give the player floor, and when they start, you don't want them to feel watched, you just want them to be able to just do their thing and just take it in, and not have like a wall of bankers just staring at them. So, we thought, "Okay, we're gonna have the Teller Ship "in the middle so you can walk around "and just take your time."

“And then, it's not about recreating an exact location that is in Mumbai, it's about finding what feels like Mumbai and building our version of that. Nothing like that exists, like it would be weird. But when you're in there when you're playing it, it kinda feels natural, in a word, it kind of flows together. So, it doesn't feel that off when you're there. But that's just up to the level design and the environment art are working together to make a space that feels believable, but still actually very gamey, in a sense.”

“What they expect is so important. It's kinda what drives us, as well, and what inspires us, too. We know that people would expect when they walk into a bank, and we really want to give it to them. We also want to add an element of surprise. And, what's so interesting about spaces like banks or shops or airports or whatever, is that you know how some of it looks like, but you've never been behind stage, right? So, you kinda wanna make sure that the players get that, too. A lot of people have been inside a vault, but then have probably seen a vault, right? What's in the movies, and stuff like that. Expectations is super important. - [Interviewer] And is it important that they sort of are in that backstage access? - Yes, yes yes, yeah, it's essential. You want to give players a look at what they expect, also because then we don't have to teach you. If we have like a spaceship as a location, right, or like an alien world, then we need to explain everything to you, but having the expectations means that players know "Okay, well if I do this, this is going to happen. We do our best to try and give them that experience. It feels awesome, as a player, that like, "Yes, that actually worked."

“then, we need to figure out "Okay, how do we make it "interesting to traverse from one end of the map "to the other end of the map?" And, we did a lot of different things. There's a lot of ways to drag the targets together. But, we also have these sky walks, which is a very, very present thing in Mumbai. These are kind of just like horizontal elevators, where you can just slip through from one end to the other end, kind of like a shortcut.”

“I had this design philosophy that the first time you go in there and you try to find that it will not be comfortable and it will not be easy to find your way around. But, the more you play it, the more you get to know it. If you play it a lot, and you master it, you will feel satisfied. That ties into knowing who the Maelstrom is. And, you can see the players who play it a lot, they're like, "Ah, I really like this," because they feel clever figuring it out. And the players who don't play it a lot, they feel lost in the level, they didn't get to master it, it's claustrophobic, they don't know, "I'm getting busted by these guards." There's a quote from one of the forums, I can't remember, but, "I started hating Mumbai, but now it's my favorite map." - I think the hard part, when we have these big events, is there's a lot of movement, there's a lot of expectations, and there's a lot of ways you can destroy them.” ^246011

“We ended up going, "Okay, Fabian is no longer a target. "The vault is the object that we need to put focus on it." But then Tobian suggested, "What if it's an optional? "Like, you either do the vault... 'cause we were afraid of the virus in Sapienza. Which, people weren't really happy with. They liked the level and they liked the targets, but they didn't like that we forced them down here to take the virus every time, and I totally get it. So, that was the idea, like, "Okay, let's have the vault as a thing, "make sure there's different ways of getting into it, "and then have the option of retrieving "the backup discs instead."

“But, what I really liked about it was the whole interaction with the mascot, 'cause you're kind of helping him out at the beginning, and you're like, "Oh, I'm looking for my keys," and then you kinda figure out, oh you want those keys, but you're kind of the guy who knocked out the poor ex-mascot and are trying to do... So, you kind of have to investigate a little bit.”

“I enjoy playing my levels after a long time that I have not touched it, 'cause when you're working on it, you're kind of like, "Oh, this sucks, and (groan)." You're so used to it, it becomes like, you don't have a really good reality on the level anymore, so you need other people to play it. So, everything else becomes super exciting. Now that you have had Mette before, and she was always working on the bank and I was testing her game before, and I was like, "Oh, this is way better It's not fair! "People are gonna hate the other one!" 'cause you just lose, completely, objectivity at a point.”
