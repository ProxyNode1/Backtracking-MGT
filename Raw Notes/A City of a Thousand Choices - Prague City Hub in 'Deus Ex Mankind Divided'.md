### Personal Notes:
- They broke down the level for the different player types. So, if a player wants to just shoot their enemies and progress, they dont have to worry about exploration to find stuff.
- The designers pushed the main locations towards the outer rings of the map. Doing this, they got an opportunity for the explorer to explore and present interesting opportunities to the killer type.

- Did they had dynamic events, which could entice the killer to engage, if they backtrack through that area?
- Do optional areas/tasks which player may not find, on their first playthrough, adds to the replay value of the game? 

- They designed the space for the things can be discovered earlier then intended. How did they made the effort and the reward, worth it?
- Does the game provide a way to rebuilt the broken relationship?
- Do you show what upgrades the player might unlock in the future, so they can plan on which ones they want to unlock and which areas will become accessible using that upgrade?
- By adding extra security in place, even though the player wasnt caught doing anything, is it messing up the perception of ghost hacker/thief?
