“The one-way door in P.T. is important because it’s a powerful example of how reducing interaction can increase the playfulness of a game. If there were more things for the player to interact with in the first half of the corridor, if backtracking offered the hope of finding a safer route, if there were more meaningful gameplay choices to make, then thinking our options would crowd out the interpretive choices that make P.T. scary. The use of a one-way door to eliminate the possibility of backtracking directs our attention away from planning our escape and toward interpreting our ominous situation.” (Totten, 2017, p. 198)

“It’s a one-way gate that always allows passage forward and never allows passage back. If it changed its state by locking and unlocking, that would imply that it might change its state in other ways. Backtracking returns as a possibility to consider. If we can’t backtrack now, it might not be because backtracking is impossible, but merely because we haven’t discovered the correct trigger yet.” (Totten, 2017, p. 199)

“It’s taken as a given that interactivity is an essential element of play. Interactivity is used to distinguish games from traditional passive art forms such as painting, literature, or film.” (Totten, 2017, p. 186)

“When we define interactivity as being fundamental to play, it makes it difficult to talk or theorize about the intervals during a play experience when no interaction is occurring.” (Totten, 2017, p. 186)

(Totten, 2017, p. 186) At which moment, there is no interaction with the game?

(Totten, 2017, p. 186) Is mental interaction also considered here? or by interactivity do they mean physical interaction?

“The difference between a good and a bad level is often not a matter of how its interactions are doled out, but how its level geometry supports noninteractive play.” (Totten, 2017, p. 187)

“the play of chess lives in this elaborated process of anticipation, not in the brief moments when you actually move your pieces. When your turn comes around, you don’t rush to move as quickly as possible. You don’t rush to interact. Instead you hold off interacting until you’ve finished your anticipatory play. And your move, when you finally do make it, is largely a matter of bookkeeping.” (Totten, 2017, p. 187)

“If you’re playing a first-person shooter, part of the fun is placing your crosshairs on a target and pulling the trigger. But there’s also fun to be had in reading the situation around you and anticipating threats before they appear. A good first-person shooter is more than just a shooting gallery.” (Totten, 2017, p. 187)

“The deepest play in a first-person shooter doesn’t occurs when you’re not shooting. It occurs when you’re trying to anticipate the threats that lie ahead of you. It occurs when you’re trying to position yourself and your weapon to give yourself an edge when the bullets do start flying.” (Totten, 2017, p. 188)

“But if players are always kept busy doing things, they don’t have the mental bandwidth to stop and consider what they’re doing or why they’re doing it.” (Totten, 2017, p. 188)

“Rainbow Six. We took a look at the levels that were the most fun in the original game, and we discovered that all of them had one thing in common: They didn’t throw the player straight into the action. Instead, they had a long approach to the main encounter area. Furthermore, these approaches offered hints of what lay ahead: a view of a sentry’s patrol path, a glimpse of how the combat zone was laid out. Often this approach was as large (in terms of level geometry) as the combat zone itself.” (Totten, 2017, p. 188)

“Players felt relatively safe, and that feeling of relative safety meant they were free to explore, observe, and analyze. They were free to anticipate.” (Totten, 2017, p. 188)

“Often right before a hard jumping challenge, there will be a safe platform for the player to stand on while considering what lies ahead. Players may actually spend longer standing on the safe platform thinking about what they’re going to do than actually doing it. The more engrossing the anticipatory play, the longer the player holds still.” (Totten, 2017, p. 188)

“Anticipatory play involves sifting through potentialities, weighing their likelihood, and imagining their possible consequences. There’s no play value in a situation where we can tell immediately how things are going to unfold.” (Totten, 2017, p. 189)

“A corridor with two doors can be longer than a corridor with only one door—it can offer the player a longer stretch of stillness—because the player has something to consider while traversing it.” (Totten, 2017, p. 189)

“But a choice only counts as a choice if the player recognizes it as such.” (Totten, 2017, p. 189)

“doors that look different offer more of a choice than doors that look the same. And doors that clearly lead to distinctive rooms offer more of a choice than doors that lead to similar corridors.” (Totten, 2017, p. 189)

“A choice ceases to be a choice if we make it over and over again.” (Totten, 2017, p. 189)

“If we repeatedly encounter the same situation, we remember how our anticipatory play previously played out and instead of experiencing the fun of sifting through potentialities, we converge instantly on a familiar resolution.” (Totten, 2017, p. 189)

“The economics of game production often preclude the creation of large numbers of single-use game assets. So variety is usually more a product of how objects are arranged than what those objects are.” (Totten, 2017, p. 189)

“One powerful way to introduce variety is to establish a familiar pattern and then break it.” (Totten, 2017, p. 189)

“The idea is not to eliminate repetition entirely. The idea is to use targeted instants of interrupted repetition to call the player’s attention to the uncertainty of their current situation and set off a cascade of anticipatory play.” (Totten, 2017, p. 190)

“An ambiguous situation is more interesting to consider if its possible outcomes generate new ambiguities of their own.” (Totten, 2017, p. 190)

“A strategic game like Go supports long runs of anticipatory play not just because each turn offers a large number of possible moves, but because each move leads to a fresh board position that invites further anticipatory play.” (Totten, 2017, p. 190)

“junction that leads to two different rooms that themselves invite additional anticipatory analysis: If I run straight through the door I might be able to dash across the open courtyard before the guards see me, but if I climb up to the balcony I might be able to sneak past them. This sort of choice is not a simple either/or proposition, but the first link in a long chain of choices that lead to a wide variety of different outcomes.” (Totten, 2017, p. 190)
