“these are not rules that are written in stone, they're just guiding principles. 4:04 They're my undereducated opinion they've been created to. 4:08 They've been created to prompt discussion, to shed a little bit of light on the black art of level design and hopefully help some people create some kick ass levels along the way.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 3)

“good level design is fun to navigate.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 3)

“for a smooth and enjoyable experience, the player should always know exactly where to go. 4:54 Which is why it's important to develop a consistent visual language that clearly guides the player through the critical path.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 4)

“What the player doesn't notice in the screenshot is equally important. 5:43 So the hidden messenger bags, the speed paths that will give you achievements, and all of these are put in there to encourage exploration, which is essentially freestyle navigation, and this helps create depth and replayability in your levels.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 4)

“sometimes it's good to throw in a little confusion. 6:05 Now, Modern Warfare 2 does this particularly well in its favela level S Highly memorable through its hectic and intense game play, it's set in a Brazilian favela.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 4)

“versicality” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 5) Verticality

“Is it easy to navigate through this level? 6:29 Absolutely not. 6:31 Is it fun? 6:32 Yes, it is. 6:33 And by carefully throwing in some well considered confusion to the mix, Triarch have created a really good sense of dramatic tension in this level.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 5)

“But creating emergent narrative is not such an obvious task because the level of designer doesn't actually create it, he merely enables it by providing the player with choice.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 7)

“Hitman is actually a great example of emergent narrative, as there's plenty of choice.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 7)

“this is freedom of choice and emergent style that's great for allowing the player to fill in the gap in your circle.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 7)

“Which is great, but too much choice can leave the player confused and in need of guidance.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 8)

“good level design always tells the player what to do, but never how to do it.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 8)

“The player needs to be in no doubt as to what he or she has to do when they go through your level, and you should provide them with clear objectives, so waypoints, other navigational aids, etcetera.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 8)

“t's it is possible to create compelling challenge through obfuscation of the details, that is to say, by providing nebulous objectives. 11:20 So keep your guidance concise and clear.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 8)

“They tell you exactly where you can find your mark and exactly who they are. 11:45 They even appear as a mark on your compass, but it never forces the player to use a singular technique to carry out the execution. 11:52 In fact, if you look at the level design for the Dark Brotherhood missions, very often specific alternate methods of execution have been set up.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 8)

“So there'll be an arrow, a bow rather, and a sheath of arrows on top of a ledge so you can strike from a distance. 12:07 Or there'll be an opportunity to kill the kill the target silently when they leave the crowd and go to a secluded spot. 12:16 So as well as not forcing the player what to do, it's important not to punish the player for improvisation.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 9)

“So veteran game designer Mark Cerny tells us that the player should be presented with concurrent objectives that can be completed in any order he or she wishes. 12:51 Furthermore, on completion of one of those objectives, the player should receive a reward which either makes the other objectives easier or modifies them in some way. 13:01 And you can see this at work in Ratchet and Clank on which Cerny consulted whereby if you complete the 1st planet, three or four planets become opened up to you and you can complete them in any way that you like. 13:17 Once you've completed one of the planets, you get a new cool gadget or a weapon that lets you open up new and alternate paths on the on the other planets. 13:27 And it's this constant flow of gadgets that keeps the player engaged as he learns to use them, Which is why good level design constantly teaches the player something new.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 9)

“Raph Coster says that the human mind enjoys processing patterns for storage and retrieval later, and a lot of the fun in playing games is derived from this pattern analysis. 14:12 If this pattern analysis ends too soon, this processing stops and the enjoyment ends.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 10)

“each level in your game should introduce, showcase or subvert a key mechanic.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 10)

“The best example of this constant teaching is any game in the Zelda series. 14:42 So when you get into a new dungeon in any elder game, you pick up a new piece of equipment, and each room in the dungeon teaches you a different way to use that piece of equipment. 14:55 Then the final Boss in that dungeon tests your mastery of the piece of equipment before it even lets you out of the dungeon. 15:02 On top of that, when you get out into the open world, you're constantly asked to learn new ways of using your equipment to access hidden areas and find all of those heart containers and large repeat chests and so on and so forth. 15:15 But it doesn't stop there. 15:16 Even the game's final boss usually requires the player to use every single bit of equipment in an unusual way,” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 10)

“the Bethesda to use to pace their games, which is learn, play, challenge, surprise” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 10)

“They'll teach the mechanics of the player explicitly. 15:43 Then they'll provide a safe area with no threat and all the toys that the player needs to kind of muck around and play with the mechanic. 15:50 Then they'll bring in some threat or a compelling objective to challenge the player's mastery of that mechanic. 15:57 And then just when the player is feeling comfortable, they'll do something crazy to surprise him.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 11)

“good level design is surprising.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 11)

“What I'm trying to say is that you need to keep everything fresh by not falling into a routine.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 11)

“the classic roller coaster pacing method, which is used to pace pretty much everything in video games.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 11)

“it's my belief that if you do this in a game, it becomes predictable pretty fast.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 11)

“he explained that fun is actually created through uncertainty” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 11)

“17:22 And by constantly flipping the player in and out of his comfort zone, you can create quite a lot of fun. 17:29 And the best way to do this is to be subversive, to take an existing game design paradigm, like the aforementioned pacing, and flip it.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 12)

“The next principle is that good level design empowers the player,” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 15)

“Red Faction Guerrilla, and it really delivers the fantasy of being a Martian rebel. 23:10 It doesn't give you a mission to drive across a toll bridge. 23:13 It gives you a mission to destroy a toll bridge using a sniper rifle that vaporizes metal. 23:21 Now this is super super empowering as it lets the player see his his effect on the environment straight away and the key gameplay mechanic in Red Faction really helps us the destructible terrain.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 17)

“use of risk reward.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 19)

“So you always design the basic path through your level to present an easy to medium challenge, and then you have clearly called out high risk paths with an obvious reward. 26:15 Or conversely, easier paths if your main path starts to get a little tough. 26:20 And it's important when you do this to use the visual language that I mentioned in the first principle.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 19)

“You can use a multi layered approach in RPGs, Action Adventures, First Person Shooters.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 20)

“You can place a powerful weapon in a tricky to reach spot, necessitating navigational risk. 27:17 You can place a dangerous enemy with a clearly called out flanking route, allowing people who have skilled in stealth an opportunity to reduce the risk. 27:25 These side paths can also be a puzzle, requiring a little more cerebral skill to access, For an example, an object that can be seen, but the root of that object is hidden secret areas that are called out with a visual cue.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 20)

“So games like Dishonored use this layered approach to good effect. 27:57 They fill the level with multiple paths for various styles and various aptitudes of player and this these multiple game play layers also extend the replayability of their levels which makes for efficient design.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 20)

“A video game always has a very finite amount of resources, whether that's the technical limitations of the hardware that you're developing on, such as the memory or the pixel, pushing power to the real world, constraints like your production schedule, the number of people on your team, the scope of your projects, and so on. 28:37 And it's a designer's responsibility to maximize the use of those resources. 28:42 And for level design, this means not only using the whole animal nerves to tail, but doing it more than once and doing it quickly.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 21)

“On top of this, this technique also creates a series of familiar moments that the player can use to learn and master your mechanics” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 21)

“Modifiers are particularly important for creating bidirectional game play. 29:53 Now your level artists or world artists are going to spend a lot of time making the levels that you design look beautiful when the unfortunate reality is that most players will blitz through them in a matter of seconds. 30:06 Now, how do you keep your level artists happy and get the most bang for your art buck? 30:12 Well, you need to reuse the nice artwork from your level.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 22)

“The most obvious way to do this is to make your player backtrack a lot, but backtracking is totally not cool. 30:22 What you should do instead is design for bidirectional gameplay. 30:25 So what I mean by that is gameplay on the way there is totally different to gameplay on the way back, and in game series it does this very well. 30:33 It is Halo.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 22)

“It begins as a search mission with exploratory gameplay, and then when you unleash the floods, all hell breaks loose and it's intense combat on the way back.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 22)

“Similarly, in Halo three, in the mission of the Ark, you fight through a desert level on foot using a sniper rifle, and then when you get to the mission to Apex you get a tank air dropped in and you can blast your way out of the level in a tank. 31:02 Totally totally different game play.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 22)

“it's very important that you don't create game play for game play's sake just to pad out your game. 31:44 You need to keep your Non-Linearity relevant by incentivizing the player by calling out clearly the reward in advance. 31:51 The heart in Dishonored is a great, great example of this. 31:55 In fact, you should also try and tie these objectives into the main narrative thread.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 23)


“Astro Boy Omega Factor that does this beautifully by actually making replaying the levels a key narrative element. 32:14 Once you've finished the game and play through all the levels trades to really quite a disappointing ending. 32:19 But somebody appears and sends Astro Boy all the way back in time to the start of the game with all of the power ups and weapons that he's collected. 32:27 He can then play through the game zapping backwards and forwards in time, using all of his different power ups to select the levels, defeat monsters that he couldn't defeat before, open up secret areas, and ultimately get the much more rewarding true conclusion to the game.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 23)

“using the game mechanics like this to create emotion is possibly the single most important goal of a level designer,” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 26)

“Now when you start to showcase your mechanics, it's important that you don't just rinse and repeat the same little setup over and over again. 41:03 You need to find creative ways to modify these mechanics and keep them fresh.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 28)

“The rid of the challenges in Batman Arkham City are a really good example of this, where the player has to use his equipment in clever new ways to unlock puzzles.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 29)

“rid of the” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 29) Riddler Trophy

“This is cool because it extends the play time and keeps the player learning, and the resultant cerebral gameplay fuels the fantasy of being the world's greatest detective rather than just a man in a Cape who's great at kicking ***.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 29)

“My question is based on a a couple of your rules to me seem to really encourage the player to take the time to figure out how to do things on their own. 47:49 Yes. 47:50 And the downside to that is obviously that the longer the player is working at that, the higher their level of frustration is climbing. 47:58 I was wondering how you approach actually creating player frustration to enable them to actually, you know, discover new mechanics on their own instead of having text on screen to direct them.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 34)

“I think it's very important to trust the player to work out your mechanics. 48:21 There's this constant kind of balancing act you have to do between the amount of work and effort you put into a certain part of your level design and the percentage chance that the player is going to work it out. 48:35 Different studios have very different approaches to this.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 34)

“You mentioned that you you think that bidirectional levels are a very good idea and I definitely agree.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 35)

“My half life rank friends they say they would say things like Oh well why would you play a game with so much copy and paste level design.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 35)

“rank” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 35) playing

“o I was wondering, like, what is a good way to make sure you don't make the players feel like it's too repetitious if they're if you're playing backwards in a level, even if the game play is different” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 35)

“So in terms of the gameplay, I've discussed using a modifier to change the gameplay on the way back” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 36)

“You can also do stuff with the lighting and the geometry so that it looks totally different depending on which direction you're approaching it from. 50:26 You can do subtle little things to make it all feel differently.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 36)

“there are other parts of the game where it's like, oh, you're making me walk through the same copy pasted level again and again and again.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 36)

“I think one of the important things to remember between Halo and Half Life is the fact that Half Life took seven years to make, I think or something like that. 50:50 So they probably had plenty of time to make lots of nice levels.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 36)

“you're asking me if level design is being dumbed down to accommodate a broader audience of players who aren't necessarily familiar with the visual tropes to guide people through levels.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 38)

“a good example of this is the first Bioshock, which had that little compass which would always point you exactly where in the direction you're supposed to go.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 38)

“When when we put Medal of Honor together, the navigability of the levels was a really big problem. 54:08 We had we had signposts pointing you in the right direction.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 38)

“We had you always had to go towards red objects. 54:16 You had compass markers, you had a little compass which would always point you in the direction you had to go. 54:21 You had a bigger arrow on the screen that told you where to go. 54:24 The the soldiers would lead you through the level, so they'd always kind of leapfrog over you to guide you through. 54:30 11 people still didn't know where to go.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 39)

“So that's again, it's about finding a balance.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 39)

“I think what you've got there is, is what I like to refer to as the designer's curse. 55:45 So you're so familiar with the, the mechanics and the setup of the levels, the level design that you know exactly what's coming. 55:51 You can preempt it.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 40)

“It almost feels like the the opposite problem from the the, from the previous question where you've got such a preloaded knowledge that you can anticipate what's going on. 56:24 And that's that's why it's really important to to disrupt that kind of standard paradigm and the pacing and the layout.” (“Ten Principles for Good Level Design-en-US.pdf”, p. 41)
