(Bounce (Level Design) - Valve Developer Community)

“A bounce is a layout element beginning with an inaccessible area, forcing the player to sidetrack and remove an obstacle before proceeding.” (“Bounce (level design) - Valve Developer Community”, p. 1)

“In terms of resources, bounces are incredibly efficient. The same areas are being used twice. The player is literally backtracking through previous rooms, which generally translates into less work for the designer.” (“Bounce (level design) - Valve Developer Community”, p. 1)

“Use of the same environment allows for effective guidance of the player. Since the player has already explored the area before, it is assumed that the player will partially remember the room structure and which exits.” (“Bounce (level design) - Valve Developer Community”, p. 1)

“bounces possess no illusion of choice. The player sidetracks and returns - they are aware of their position in relation to the rest of the level. If nothing interesting happens on the return trip and it is not obvious what has happened, then, especially if it is of length, this will stick out as very badly implemented backtracking to a lot of players.” (“Bounce (level design) - Valve Developer Community”, p. 1)

“Players don't mind backtracking when the goal seems clear or purposeful, and the trek is not overly long” (“Bounce (level design) - Valve Developer Community”, p. 1)

“The player is essentially traveling in a circle and their sense of progress is diminished.” (“Bounce (level design) - Valve Developer Community”, p. 1)

“most bounces were either optional or short” (“Bounce (level design) - Valve Developer Community”, p. 1)

“This bounce is used for dramatic effect, primarily to emphasize the contrast between the pre-disaster and the post-disaster Black Mesa.” (“Bounce (level design) - Valve Developer Community”, p. 2)

“When Gordon initially arrives, he is greeted by friendly NPCs and playfully chastised for being late to work again. After the resonance cascade, the player's former colleagues have mutated into zombies; dead bodies and wreckage are strewn about the level; the lighting is noticeably darker.” (“Bounce (level design) - Valve Developer Community”, p. 2)

“The player must leave the airboat, fight through a small Combine outpost, blow up a couple of flammable barrels thereby breaking open the canal doors (seen in the picture on the right), then backtrack to the airboat and proceed through.” (“Bounce (level design) - Valve Developer Community”, p. 2)

“Its task is to hold up the player's advancement and divert them to a nearby location for them to be able to proceed further into the game.” (“Bounce (level design) - Valve Developer Community”, p. 2)

“In Highway 17, The player must fight off a Combine drop team and a number of poison headcrab zombies, only to discover that the way onward is blocked by a force field. To disable it, the buggy must be left behind and the player has to climb their way beneath the bridge to the other side and push a button in a control room. Then, on the way back, a Combine gunship must be fought off, after which the player can proceed through the force field.” (“Bounce (level design) - Valve Developer Community”, p. 2)

“The player fights Combine soldiers, rollermines, and manhacks (and a few headcrabs) all the way down to the deepest reaches of the bunker under the island.” (“Bounce (level design) - Valve Developer Community”, p. 3)

“At this place, a powerful amount of force wrecks the bunker,” (“Bounce (level design) - Valve Developer Community”, p. 3)

“The player then fights back up through the bunker, taking the same path mostly, but now with zombies and a destroyed environment” (“Bounce (level design) - Valve Developer Community”, p. 3)
