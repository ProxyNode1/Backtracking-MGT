“LEVEL FLOW” (Byrne, 2005, p. 84)

“the fun drops to a point where it’s no longer worth the time to playit.” (Byrne, 2005, p. 84)

“when a level’s “flow” breaks down. Flow and rhythm are deeply connected concepts, and hard to separate concretely,” (Byrne, 2005, p. 84)

“the level designer is the invisible hand guiding the player through each environment in a game, sometimes by pushing him to go through a certain doorway or defeat a particular challenge, and often by subtly pulling him along by using lighting, sound effects, item placement, and other “bread crumbs”” (Byrne, 2005, p. 84)

“the more aware the player is of the level designer’s influence, the less fun the level will be,just because it’s obvious that things have been engineered to happen artificially.” (Byrne, 2005, p. 84) Patterns are obvious

“Another very obvious way to create bad flow is physically blocking the player, or making him perform complex maneuvers for what should be simple tasks.” (Byrne, 2005, p. 84) Simple task from the perspective of the player?

“Often forcing players to perform tedious tasks in a level is simply making them jump through hoops.” (Byrne, 2005, p. 85)

“Be aware of what flow means to your game, and design your level for that.” (Byrne, 2005, p. 85)

“Adventure games can suffer from too many irrelevant action sequences, but they also suffer from puzzle after puzzle with no break in between, for example.” (Byrne, 2005, p. 85)

“Dissonance or jumping through too many hoops is only one occurrence that can break the flow. More commonly, it’s simply a matter of the player becoming bored.” (Byrne, 2005, p. 86)

“A player can often become bored by doing the same thing for too long, even if that thing is something we developers consider exciting.” (Byrne, 2005, p. 86)

“Mental boredom comes from seeing the same things, hearing the same sounds and music, or playing essentially the same gameplay repeatedly seemingly without end.” (Byrne, 2005, p. 86)

“Forcing the player to backtrack through a level can be an interesting game element if the level has changed sufficiently in the meantime or if there are new challenges on the way back.” (Byrne, 2005, p. 87)

“However, simply forcing the player to go from one end of the map to the other constantly, spending long minutes simply trudging through the same space every time, will surely reduce the flow to a crawl.” (Byrne, 2005, p. 87)

“Items introduced in earlier levels can affect your map depending on whether the player chooses to use them. Elements introduced inlater levels may also affect yoursif the player is allowed to return later. Games often disallow “backtracking” or letting the player move backward through a level, for this very reason. It becomes difficult to know what the player will be equipped with, or capable of, at any point in your level when they can come or go at will throughout the game.” (Byrne, 2005, p. 168)
