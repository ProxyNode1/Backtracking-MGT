# Understand my Research

- I as a designer has created a sequence in one of my level.
- I give the level to players to play and get their feedback.
- I get the feedback that says "I did not enjoy the level. I had to backtrack and that was tedious and frustrated me".
- I now have to understand what do they mean by their feedback.


I ask questions:
- What do they mean when they say use the term "backtrack"?
- What was the cause of it feeling tedious and lead to frustration?
	- When would t
- What should I do to fix the cause of the problem?

### What is the main goal of my research?
- Is it to educate the players, in case they are using wrong terminology?
- Is it to understand their feedback, before a dev attempt to solve the issue stated in the feedback?
- Am I trying to determine, in case I want to  backtracking in my level, what things should I consider?
