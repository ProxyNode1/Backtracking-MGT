## Interview:
 - Could you tell me a bit about your game dev experience.
   
 - Many video games have levels where the player has to go back along a path that they had previously moved through. Have you played any game where you had to do this?
	 - If no, 
		 - Skip to next question.

		 - If good,
			 - What do you think contributed to the success of it?
		   
	 - If No, 
		 - what is your opinion about this idea?
	
 - Say if you are working on a new level, and you want to have this sequence in it, how will you determine if having this sequence in you level will be an appropriate decision?
   
 - Going back to the first question, among the games that you mentioned, when you had move back along the same space that you previously moved through, what did you feel?

 - What purpose does this it serve in level design?
   
 - Do you think there are any benefits of having levels with sequences where player have to move around in same space, multiple times? 
   
 - Can you give some examples of level or sections in a levels in games where it was appropriate or inappropriate?
